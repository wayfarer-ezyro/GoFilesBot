# GoFilesBot üóÇ

A Telegram Filter bot (Especially for movie groups) differed with its mode of operation.

## üí† Mode of Operation:

- A Super group and channel need to perform the bot function.
- Members who send file names will search by the bot in channel and send the media to the member personally (as PM)
- Group members doesn't have access to the channel directly.
- Group will remain safe as the chat doesn't contain any media in it.
- If in an emergency, Authorized admins can delete entire group messages in ```/cleanchat``` command

### Advantage :
1. Users don't have access to the main channel will help to avoid copyright infringement
2. Medias will only get from bot as pm only when asked in the Movie group.
3. Absence of media in the group will help to avoid copyright infringement.
3. Medias won't get from bot in direct PM (Except a vulnerability - Pros can find it.., lads keep playing..)
4. Finally, filter objects doesn't need to be added in the bot as the bot is searching in realtime with the key-word.

## üí† Requirements:
```
TG_BOT_TOKEN    - Get from @BotFather
APP_ID          - Get from my.telegram.org
API_HASH        - Get from my.telegram.org

CHANNELS        - List of Channel ids (Starts with -100) seperated by <space>
AUTH_USERS      - List of Autherized user ids separated by <space>
GROUP_U_NAME    - Username of the group to tag in sending medias
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **TG_USER_SESSION Must be  made from an admin User present in the Group & channels** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üí† @BotFather Command:
